eLabs Dot Files


Installation

  git clone git://github.com/elabs/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  ./setup
  source ~/.bash_profile
  # edit ~/.gitconfig and personalize it

Submodules

The vim plugins/syntax files come as git submodules. To initiate do the following:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

Environment

If you would like to switch to zsh, you can do so with
the following command.

  chsh -s /bin/zsh

Features

Coding projects in ~/Projects can easily be accessed (and tab completed) with the "p" command.

  p serenity<tab>

There is also an "h" command which behaves similar, but acts on the
home path.

  h doc<tab>

Tab completion is also added to rake and cap commands:

  rake db:mi<tab>
  cap de<tab>

To speed things up, the results are cached in local .rake_tasks~ and
.cap_tasks~. It is smart enough to expire the cache automatically in
most cases, but you can simply remove the files to flush the cache.

There are a few key bindings set. Many of these require option to be
set as the meta key. Option-left/right arrow will move cursor by word,
and control-left/right will move to beginning and end of line.
Control-option-N will open a new tab with the current directory under
Mac OS X Terminal.

If you're using git, you'll notice the current branch name shows up in
the prompt while in a git repository.

If you're using Rails, you'll find some handy aliases (below). You can
also use show_log and hide_log in script/console to show the log inline.

  ss       # script/server
  sc       # script/console
  sg       # script/generate
  a        # autotest
  tlog     # tail -f log/development.log
  rst      # touch tmp/restart.txt
  migrate  # rake db:migrate db:test:clone
  scaffold # script/generate nifty_scaffold

See the other aliases in ~/.zsh/aliases

If there are some shell configuration settings which you want secure or
specific to one system, place it into a ~/.localrc file. This will be
loaded automatically if it exists.

There are several features enabled in Ruby's irb including history,
completion and auto-indent. Many convenience methods are added as well
such as "ri" which can be used to get inline documentation in IRB.
See irbrc and railsrc files for details.
